                    <p>Welcome to the lawn of the building known as Old Main on the campus of Arizona State University. Old Main, now a preserved historical building, was designed by W.A. McGinnis, and it is the oldest building on campus. The construction started in 1894, twenty years before Arizona became a state and one year after Geranamo surrendered. This building was the first in Tempe to be wired for electricity.</p>

                    <p>Our family is in the architecture business, so I have to point out that this structure is made of three stories of tall brick, including a full basement set on a granite base. Its design is primarily Queen Anne, but it shows the influence of the Romanesque style.</p>

                    <p>One of the traits that Taylor and Ryan appreciate in each other is their love of learning and education. Their inner intellectuals found each other, and on their third date, they had lunch at the Postino Annex on the other side of University Drive and walked over here on a hot summer's day to see the fountain and Old Main.</p>
